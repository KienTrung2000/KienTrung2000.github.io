								<h2 class="major">Team Profile</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/personality.png" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/learningstyle.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>a.	Team Name:
									My current team consists of four people, namely Trung Kien, Huynh Khang, Duc Minh and Anh Quang. Therefore, I decide to choose “4NE1” as my team name. The reason why I choose this name is that we are four separate individuals without knowing each other before. However, when we met, we shared our common goal together, which is bettering ourselves and becoming successful in the prospective future. Especially in the IT field, we are dedicated and willing to explore new things as well as new concepts in order to make the world more modern and innovative with the application of technologies.</a>.</p>
								<p>b.	Team Profile:
									On my first assignment, I have already done the personality test by using Myers – Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), where users have to answer a questionnaire to see how they perceive the world and make decisions. Thanks to the result, I am able to understand myself more clearly with five different areas, namely mind, energy, nature, tactics and identity so that I can find my appropriate teammates, who will have the same personality with mine or at least we can work together without causing any conflicts. Indeed , I am considered to show a personality type of the Defender, who are tend to be introverted, observant, feeling, judging and turbulent. Moreover, I am efficient and responsible with the ability of paying careful attention to every details in my daily life.
									In addition, I also took the Learning Style test, which seems to be part of the recruitment process in the future. In particular, the result indicates that I belong to the auditory learner group, who prefer hearing and listening to acquire knowledge. In fact, I find much easier to memorize things by listening carefully and store information in my head rather than noting down and never reading it. Furthermore, I tend to talk or discuss with people when I feel bored because I get interested in hearing what others say about either a specific topic or just a small story.</p>
								<p> Hence, according to those two tests, I can finally orient how my upcoming teammates for Assignment 3 will be. Firstly, they should be a good speaker, who are willing to talk and share their opinions with others. In other words, they have the ability of creating a connection among team members with their voice since I lack of this skill, which I am unable to make myself a central of the discussion. Secondly, while I make decisions via feeling, I need someone to resolve problems by thinking. Indeed, according to Norbert Schwarz and Ian Skurnik (2003), it is much better to use your brain instead of your emotion to create a good outcome in some specific cases. In fact, whenever you think carefully or brainstorm ideas before speaking them out, your opinions are more likely to be logical and persuasive, which can thoroughly solve the problems. In contrast, you solve the problem based on your current either positive or negative emotion, which is not certain and may lead to unwise decisions, sometimes. As a result, with a judicious mind, that teammate can help whole team overcome difficulties easily such as misunderstanding or misconception during working together. Thirdly, apart from the personality, it is hard to deny that hobby is also a good factor to help form a good team. Undoubtedly, if we share common hobbies such as playing video games, reading books and so on, we can create a close bond among team members that make the teamwork more comfortable and exciting with high encouragement (Kimberly Zhang, 2020). Thanks to it, everyone will work more productively as well as passionately resulting in optimal outcome.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Idea & Feedbacks</h2>
								<p>•	Overview:
									After a long time of nurture, I finally come up with my project idea, which is about developing a game by using Unity tool. In fact, Unity is the ultimate game development platform developed by Unity Technologies. By using it, developers are able to create high – quality both 2D and 3D games, which can be deployed on desktop, mobile devices, consoles and websites. Therefore, as a young and passionate developer, I am willing to utilize Unity with many amazing provided features in order to build my own spirit child for the game industry. In general, I intend to make a mobile game with simple gameplay but addictive that will be available on both IOS and Android platforms.</p>
								<p>•	Motivation:
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/flappybird.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									In fact, I get the inspiration from Mr. Nguyen Ha Dong, who is the developer of Flappy Bird. In 2013, it was very famous within gamer community with $50,000 earned per day and became the most downloaded free game in App store of IOS. However, it has been removed since the beginning of 2014 for some reasons. By inheriting his legacy, I do want to make a mobile game following the Indie plus RPG (Role Playing Games) genre. Particularly, my game is designed to have a relaxed gameplay with an appealing plot so that everyone from child to adult can play in his or her free time. The other reason why urges me to make this game is that players, especially children tend to express more aggressive behavior after playing violent games, according to Birkbeck University of London (2019). Hence, I want to solve this problem by providing “less violent” games but still be able to attract players.</p>
								<p>•	Description:
									In detail, our game is called The Hidden Treasure, where users will play a role of various characters and go finding their forsaken treasures. At the beginning, we only provide five free characters with different personalities, abilities and stories so that players will not feel bored because they can choose whoever they want to become. Then, if players want to unlock new characters with interesting features and eye-catching appearances, they have to complete the game missions to earn coins and buy them at the store. Moreover, we want to provide a fair playground that everyone will be equal and need to play to be better instead of applying pay-to-win method like most of the games nowadays. Talking about the gameplay, we ensure that it is very fascinating and addictive that players can hardly keep their eyes from it. Indeed, each character will have dissimilar journey leading to the final treasure. On the journey, there will be diversified activities and tasks such as solving puzzles, exploring caves or finding materials for players to experience. By doing this, we are able to broaden the freedom and try not to strict player’s interaction in a certain framework. Furthermore, the journey will be divided into various chapters with different stories, which is about four chapters. Whenever players reach a new chapter, they will automatically receive rewards such as a box of coins or new looking for their current character. Thanks to it, we can encourage players to keep on playing and getting the payoff for the amount of time they have spent on our game.
									Besides, according to Cassidy, Gianna and Raymond MacDonald (2009), players tend to show positive emotional response and enjoyment when they hear a good soundtrack during gameplay. Hence, music is also a vital factor for the success of our game, so we attempt to make it wonderful. To be specific, the soundtrack of the game will be melodious and quite catchy so that we can boost the relaxation level and make players as comfortable as possible. In order to do that, we can look for an instrumental music online and download it to our game. In addition, there is no age restriction, which means it is suitable for every audiences and they are free to download it on App Store of IOS or Google Play of Android. Definitely, for each 2-3 months, we will conduct updating patches in order to fix errors, add new features and improve user experience.</p>
								<p>•	Tools and Technologies:
									As mentioned above, Unity is a free downloadable gaming programming software helping me to create a game easily. In order to understand and get full advantage of Unity, I need to learn about C# programming language, which is the primary language of every Unity’s coding activities. Fortunately, I can find various tutorials about this language on YouTube or on some online blogs, so I can learn by myself without spending money. Specifically, Unity provides users with many functional features such as editing objects and characters in game; or controlling the surrounding environment (light, weather, etc.). These will make developers to unleash their creativity with thousands of designing ideas with the aim of building a high quality game for the community. In addition to Unity, I can try Photoshop tool such as Adobe Illustrator to enhance the ability of editing game contents without many complex codes needed.</p>
								<p>•	Skills Required:
									In terms of necessary skills, it is inevitable to master myself in programming skills because everything in my game must be done by coding activities. In fact, Unity not only offers developers with one of the best tools for programming game but a variety of online courses as well so that their users can attend the guidance and acquire from beginner to advance skills. Indeed, there are numerous programming languages that I must understand deeply such as AI, graphic, sound programming in order to create a complete game.
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Unity.png" alt="" /></span>
									Moreover, one another important skill is communication. Certainly, it is more difficult to develop a game individually than work as a group. Therefore, each person will need to communicate with other team members to discuss ideas, implement them as well as support each other with their tasks.</p>
								<p>•	Outcome:
									Assuming that the project is successful, my team can introduce a brand new game made by Vietnamese people to the world. Thanks to it, we can gain profit from downloaded rate and increase the reputation of game developers from Vietnam in other countries. Furthermore, in terms of the original problem, I believe that the Hidden Treasure is qualified to reduce the negative effect on players’ behavior. In detail, the goal of this game is to ease players with relaxing and minimal gameplay after a hard working day. Consequently, people can enjoy a peaceful experience via exploring the game without being too serious or stressful to win the game.</p>
								<p>Khang and Minh feedbacks:
									After reading through and putting some thoughts on Kien’s Hidden Treasure game project, we want to give him some feedbacks on his project idea. Honestly, we think that is it a great idea. Indeed, we are big gamers nerd ourselves especially for the classical RPG genres. I feel there is always room for an indie game with great story, simple and interactive gameplay and great soundtrack in the world, since there are so few of them out there that is actually good nowadays. Kien’s Hidden Treasure give us the impression of the infamous Undertale game, which also a puzzle indie type RPG created by Toby Fox. It checks all the mark with great original soundtracks, simple visual direction and diverse interactive gameplay. Therefore, if Hidden Treasure can be created, it definitely has potential to be successful. With that being said, we also have some questions: Hidden Treasures specifically stay away from pay-to-win and pay-to-play, and there are also no advertisements, how can the creator generate income to continue develop the game and earn revenue? Because a big project with quality gameplay, design, soundtrack is very costly.</p>
								<p>My reflection:
									First of all, I want to express my appreciation to Khang and Minh for having spent time carrying out some feedbacks for my project idea. Obviously, I find that their feedbacks are very useful and constructive to help me improve my product. Indeed, they love and support my idea, which will create more motivation for me to make my idea a reality. Moreover, I totally agree with their question is that how I can generate the profit without charging players. Hence, in addition to earning money from downloaded rate from digital distribution platforms (App store, Google Play), I can offer other game developers to put their game advertisements into mine. Consequently, whenever players play my game, they can also see various game titles and go check for them. In return, other developers will pay me money for popularizing their products.</p>

								<p>•	Cybersecurity and Privacy:
								<p>What does it do?</p>
									In the modern and civilized world like nowadays, human life is gradually becoming more and more advanced with the significant improvement of living standard, facility and technology as well. Especially the internet, it plays an important role in daily life, which people use to search & store every kind of information, upload photos or videos to share their moments with family and friends. Therefore, it becomes a sensitive area, where many hackers can steal and leak your data out in order to achieve their illegal goals. As a result, Information Technology (IT) was born with the aim of minimizing the risk of technology. Indeed, one of the vital aspects of IT that help to ensure the network security is Cybersecurity.
									In general, Cybersecurity is the practice of protection preventing systems, programs and networks from digital attacks or cyberattacks. An effective cybersecurity is believed to have multiple layers of protection to create a solid defense from cyberattacks. Indeed, without it, the IT assets can be dangerous and vulnerable due to the existence of more and more skillful hackers. Hence, it is very necessary for not only all businesses of companies but also each individual to equip this software to their technological gadgets to keep the data as safe as possible. In fact, we can divide cybersecurity into some specific categories:
								<p>-	Network security: It is the practice of protecting computer network from the outsiders either it is purposeful attack or unknown malware (malicious software)</p>
								<p>-	Application security: Concentrate on keeping the software and devices out of dangers. Apps are required to frequently updates and testing to enhance the ability of blocking attacks.</p>
								<p>-	Information security: One of the essential layer of security to guard the privacy of data within storage and transaction.</p>
								<p>-	End-user education: User is one of the most unpredictable cyberattack. People often accidentally let the viruses penetrate the system network because of lacking knowledge about security practices. Therefore, education is inevitable such as delete suspicious or junk mail attachments and avoid using unidentified USB.</p>
								<p>Moreover, in the next three years, there will be some new issues related to Cybersecurity. For instance, AI will be implemented as a core component of every cybersecurity system. Specifically, future developers can use AI to warn users about dangerous websites or bad security choices. Furthermore, they can take an advantage of AI to identify the security problems initially in order to carry out remedies timely. In contrast, it is certain to have more hackers to confront in the future. Indeed, the tech workforce is expanding bigger and bigger with sophisticated workers thanks to innovative education. Nevertheless, there seem to be shortage of suitable jobs for those workers, making them to become hackers or cybercrimes. Consequently, the government should try to create more job opportunities as well as conducting job orientation programs to reduce the number of negative workers, who follow the criminal path.</p>
									What is the likely impact?
									Since the human society is growing to be more reliant on technology, so does the importance of Cybersecurity. Indeed, people always use technology as a main tool to serve their daily tasks. For example, they use PCs and mobile devices to store personal information or important documents instead of writing down to paper like before, which is convenient and save more time. However, they must manage those data carefully and foresee the probability of being stolen by hackers someday in order to concern about applying cybersecurity practices. Furthermore, group of hackers are expanding considerably with more dangerous and clever criminal from around the world, who can withdraw all of your cash in bank account within a few minutes. By utilizing a good cybersecurity system, people can partially secure their data along with sensitive information from leakage, which will cause negative influences to their life. Considering the organizational level, it is much more necessary to ensure the safety of firm’s data against cybercrimes. Undoubtedly, a firm can include a hundred or even thousands of various data from different offices, which is in need of saving it confidentially. Otherwise, the rivals can get the information about their strategies or someone may use it for wrong purposes, which can lead to the collapse of a whole company. Hence, I believe that everyone who is using technology can be affected by the development of cybersecurity. In addition, the job opportunities for this working field are very diversified with many potential positions such as Information Security Analyst, Penetration Tester, Security Architect, Systems Engineer and so forth.
									How will this affect you?
									In addition to affecting the society, Cybersecurity also affect my daily life in some aspects. To begin with, I have to admit that I usually store a lot of private information or photos and videos recording my life for personal purposes. Therefore, it will be dangerous if someone can hack my information and leak it outside for malicious purposes. Besides, not only myself but also every technology users mainly exchange information via the internet from just a small conversation to important one related to business work. Nonetheless, regardless of the kind of information, users should care about the cybersecurity protection as well as understanding how the internet is operated in order to avoid unwanted risks. Overall, it is hard to deny the indispensability of Cybersecurity in the rapidly changing world, where each individual should know how to protect themselves and their beloved by learning and broadening their knowledge about this kind of data protection.
